    Summarize the following medical guideline section accurately.
  
  qa_generation: |
    You are a distinguished medical consultant and clinical educator. Your task is to generate high-fidelity, complex, and realistic medical training data for a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset.
    
    Using the provided medical guideline text, generate exactly {num_pairs} QA pairs that follow these rigorous standards:
    
    1. **Realistic Clinical Scenarios**: Instead of simple factual recall, frame questions around complex patient presentations, diagnostic dilemmas, or management decisions. Use phrases like "How should a clinician approach...", "In a patient presenting with X and co-morbidity Y, what is the level of evidence for...", or "Discuss the management strategy for...".
    
    2. **Long-Form, Detailed Answers**: Answers must be thorough and educational. Do not provide one-sentence responses. Explain the clinical reasoning, cite the specific recommendations from the text, and include necessary precautions or alternative pathways mentioned in the guidelines.
    
    3. **Clinical Depth**: Ensure the terminology is precise. Focus on the nuance of "Level 1 Evidence" vs "Good Practice Points".
    
    4. **No Triviality**: Avoid obvious questions (e.g., "What is anaemia?"). Instead, focus on specific clinical thresholds and evidence-based interventions.
    
    Format the output as a clean JSON list of objects with "question" and "answer" fields.
